description: |
  SipHash is a family of pseudorandom functions (a.k.a. keyed hash functions) optimized for speed on short messages.

  Target applications include network traffic authentication and defense against hash-flooding DoS attacks.

  SipHash is secure, fast, and simple (for real):
  - SipHash is simpler and faster than previous cryptographic algorithms (e.g. MACs based on universal hashing)
  - SipHash is competitive in performance with insecure non-cryptographic algorithms (e.g. MurmurHash)
